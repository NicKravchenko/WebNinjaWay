    <h1>I let love in</h1>

    <h2>Nick Cave</h2>

    <h3>First verse</h3>

    <p><b>Despair</b> and deception, love's ugly little twins
        <br>Came a-knocking on my door, I let them in
        <br><b>Darling</b>, you're the punishment for all of my former sins
        <br>I let love in, I let love in
    </p>

    <h3>Second verse</h3>

    <p>The door it opened just a crack but love was shrewed and bold
        <br>My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold
        <br>A life sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole
        <br>I let love in, I let love in
        <br>I let love in, I let love in
    </p>

    <h3>Third verse</h3>

    <p>So if you're sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at you door
        <br>And the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned
        <br>Far worse to be love's lover than the lover that love has scorned
        <br>I let love in, I let love in
        <br>Yeah, I let love in, I let it in
        <br>I let love in, babe, I let love in
        <br>I let love in, I let love
    </p>
